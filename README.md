# Distinguishability

## Description
This repository contains the coding implementations of a new criterion which defines the extent of heterogeneity among replicable effects, into both the model comparison and model criticism frameworks.

## R srouce and Cpp source
Source codes for the Cpp implementation and Rcpp wrap-up of distinguishability are included in Rcpp_src and cpp_src folders. 

## Applications
The code to reproduce the numerical illustrations (simulation, RP:P and RNA-seq application) is under the distinguishability_paper folder. Separate README.md files are under each sub-folder.
